Robust, dynamic, highly customizable reading application with picture/text editing, social networking, and sharing features. The application can be used on all iOS devices and is being developed programmatically using Objective C. I am targeting shipping the application early April of 2016.

So far the UI/UX aspect of the application is close to completion and all of it's reading features are in place. I am working on linking various eBook provider's APIs to give users a vast variety of sources to select from.

iOS's Core Animation, NSTimers, CADisplayLinks were heavily used in developing this application thus far.
